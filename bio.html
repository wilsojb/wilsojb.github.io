			My name is Joshua Wilson. This is my favorite music video. My favorite food is pho. When I'm not <a ref="">here</a>, I'm dreaming about being <a ref="">here</a>, or <a ref="">here</a>, or <a ref="">here</a>.

		<div class="fullbio">
			<p>I grew up in Arkansas and lived in North Carolina for awhile, but currently reside in Brooklyn. I take great pride in my southern roots. </p>

			<p>I was educated at <a ref="http://www.hendrix.edu">Hendrix College</a> and <a ref="http://www.unc.edu">UNC - Chapel Hill</a>. I have also always done a considerable amount of self-study. Before (fully) joining the tech world, I studied Physics with the hope of one day being a professor. Although my passions exist elsewhere now, I still love sharing my knowledge with others.</p>

		<div class="hobbies">
			<p>I have a diverse sense of interest. Anything ranging from funny tshirt design and production, real estate investing, developing gaming apps for children, home brewing, or overnight hiking trips sounds right up my alley. More generally, I just love having a project. Problem solving is my passion and I'm fortunate to have figured that out early in my life (read: I always did the extra credit on math exams and built model rockets as a kid).</p>

			<p>More recently, simple pleasures like exercising, eating well, and keeping my inbox at zero have been keeping me busy. I enjoy running, hiking, and snowboarding, and jump on any opportunity to be outdoors</p>

			<p>I also love to travel. I've spent time in both London and Singapore for work and have also traveled to numerous locations around Europe, Asia, and North America. I've driven every mile of I-40 from Sante Fe, NM to Wilmington, NC and have <a ref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaggeration">definitely</a> stopped at every gas station between Little Rock and Denver.</p>
