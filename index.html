        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve been writing code for over a decade, and over that time many languages have had the dubious
          distinction of being my “main” language. I cut my teeth on TI-BASIC in high school and (more formally)
          on Java in undergrad, wrote a ton of C++ and Fortran90 for my graduate thesis, hacked Perl and Bash scripts
          together for Wall Street and eventually fell for Python. Sys admining a MongoDB cluster turned me on to Javascript
          and, currently, I’m writing hybrid mobile apps using Ionic, AngularJS, and Cordova. It’s been a humbling experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is still my area of expertise, but I’m learning more every day about the modern client-side web as
          well as Android and iOS integration. I used to be fairly dogmatic about object-oriented design (as is probably anyone
          that started with Java), now I favor a more balanced approach.
        </p>

        <h3>I like to build things</h3>
        <p>
          I've built mobile apps for both Android and iOS, written internal tools for a top hft firm, released
          a pde solver while in grad. school, and even designed a thrust sensor for a rocket. I've dabbled
          in home brewing, once constructed a trebuchet, and enjoy fixing a 1999 Jeep Cherokee on the regular.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like to help others build things. Working with a team of programmers is always fun and rewarding. I
          appreciate good code reviews, testing, and a rock solid release process. Not all problems are techincal
          in nature, so neither are all solutions. If you have something you'd like to build, and you think I
          could help you, then please <a href="" ng-click="transition('home')">reach out</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A mobile app for iOS and Android built using AngularJS and
          <a target="_blank" href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>. Coming Spring 2016.

          Simple (temporary) website deployment from the command line. An experiment that used Flask,
          Google App Engine, and Datastore.

        <p>
          Was a member of a tight-knit, highly productive team responsible for monitoring market conditions,
          connectivity, and all continuously-deployed internal systems. Working on a new feature, debugging
          legacy software, reviewing a pile of pull requests, and dealing with a market outage were all in a
          day’s work. I also played an active role in their hiring, training, and documentation efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my time was spent developing internal tools in Perl, Bash, and Python. I met with other engineers
          and business teams on a weekly basis and played an integral role in converting a legacy code base
          into a library of tools used company-wide. I helped define and steward technical standards and
          implemented a test-driven development lifecycle. I was also responsible for administering  and scaling
          a MongoDB replica set.
        </p>

        <h3>Pdelab</h3>
        <p>
          An object oriented framework for solving and analyzing PDEs. Homegrown solvers, graphing utilities, and
          examples that came out of <a href="http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/etd/id/3322" target="_blank" >
          grad school</a>. The code can be found on <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/wilsojb/pdelab">github</a>
          (mostly C++ w/ Python glue).
