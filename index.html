        <h3>Hello</h3>
        <p>
          I'm Joshua Wilson. I'm a project manager and programmer that lives in Brookyn, NY
          but hails from El Dorado, AR. <a href="" class="user-mention">@wilsojb</a> is my handle on
          many services ('wilsonjb' was already taken). Some of my favorite things include bbq, snowboarding,
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator">this font</a>, and
          <a target="_blank" href="http://xph.us/2013/01/22/inbox-zero-for-life.html">this blog post</a>.

        <p>
          While you're here, take a look at what's been <a href="" ng-click="transition('projects')">keeping me busy</a>. If you have
          something you'd like to build and you think I could help, then please reach out. I'm currently interested in
          opportunities involving data science, mobile development, and infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve been writing code for over a decade. Over that time many languages have had the dubious
          distinction of being my “main” language. I cut my teeth on TI-BASIC in high school and (more formally)
          on Java in undergrad; I wrote a ton of C++ and Fortran90 for my graduate thesis, hacked Perl and Bash scripts
          together for Wall Street, and eventually fell for Python. Sys admining a MongoDB cluster turned me on to Javascript
          and, currently, I’m writing hybrid mobile apps using Ionic, AngularJS, and Cordova. It’s been a humbling experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is still my area of expertise, but I'm constantly learning more about today's client-side web as
          well as Android and iOS integration. I used to be fairly dogmatic about object-oriented design (as is probably anyone
          that started with Java), now I favor a more balanced approach.
        </p>

        <h3>I like to build things</h3>
        <p>
          I've built mobile apps for both Android and iOS, written internal tools for a top hft firm, released
          a pde solver while in grad. school, and even designed a thrust sensor for a rocket. I've dabbled
          in home brewing, once constructed a trebuchet, and enjoy fixing a 1999 Jeep Cherokee on the regular.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like to help others build things. Working with a team of programmers is always fun and rewarding. I
          appreciate good code reviews, testing, and a rock solid release process. Not all problems are techincal
          in nature, so neither are all solutions. If you have something you'd like to build and you think I could
          help, then please <a href="" ng-click="transition('home')">reach out</a>.

        <p>
          An app for iOS and Android built using Cordova, AngularJS, and the Ionic framework
          that complements <a href="http://tripexpert.com" target="_blank">www.tripexpert.com</a>.
          Coming Spring 2016.

        <a target="_blank" href="http://snapsite.io"><h3 class="snapsite">snapsite.io</h3></a>
        <p>
          Simple (temporary) website deployment from the command line. An experiment that used Flask,
          Google App Engine, and Datastore.

        <p>
          I spent most of my time developing internal tools in Python, MongoDB, Perl, and Bash, as the company
          grew from 60-100+ employees. This is where I learned everything I know about systems programming,
          test-driven development lifecycles, and the data pipeline. I played an integral role in converting a
          legacy code base into a library of tools that helped their business internationally scale. My day consisted
          of reviewing pull requests, committing quick fixes and new features, and dealing with the occasional market outage.
        </p>

        <h3>Pdelab</h3>
        <p>
          An object oriented framework for solving and analyzing PDEs. This project grew organically while I worked on
          my <a href="http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/etd/id/3322" target="_blank">graduate degree</a>. The goal
          of the framework was to abstract away the mechanics and other "lower level" code needed to solve PDEs so the
          researcher can spend more time focusing on their solver (i.e. their "business logic"). The code can be found on
          <a target="_blank" href="http://wilsojb.io/pdelab">github</a>.
