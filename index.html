        <p>
          I'm Josh. I like to build things, usually with software. Currently, I'm
          working as a data engineer for a start up that does a lot of
          data engineering, <a href="http://enigma.io/" target="_blank">Enigma</a>.
          Some of my favorite things include sandwiches, snowboarding,

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve been writing code for over a decade. Over that time, many languages have had the
          dubious distinction of being my “main” language. I cut my teeth on TI-BASIC in high
          school and (more formally) on Java in undergrad. C++ and Fortran90 came in handy during
          graduate school. I hacked Perl and Bash scripts for Wall Street for awhile before eventually
          finding (and falling for) Python. I've been the sys admin of a large<em>-ish</em> MongoDB
          cluster and also one of its lead developers. Somewhere along the way, I stumbled into Javascript
          and the rapidly evolving world of frontend tooling and frameworks. Lately, I've been contributing
          to <a target="_blank" href="http://enigma.io/parsekit/">ParseKit</a> at
          <a target="_blank" href="http://enigma.io">Enigma</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is still my area of expertise, but I'm constantly learning more about today's
          client-side web as well as mobile and desktop integration. While I'm good at implementing
          the layers needed to make things work, I am not comfortable with buzzwords like
          <a href="http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html" target="_blank">"Full-stack Developer"</a>.
          For the purposes of classification, the phrases "backend engineer", "internal tools developer",
          and "casual frontend developer" probably describe me the best. I also have experience doing the job
          of a "site reliability engineer" though I don't enjoy that line of work anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to be fairly dogmatic about object-oriented design (as is probably anyone that started with Java),
          but now I favor a more balanced approach. I value 80 char limits, simple interfaces, PEP8 compliance,
          and the spectrum between writing well-tested architectures and
          <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html" target="_blank">getting things done</a>.
          One of the most valuable skills a person can have is the ability to learn, closely followed by the ability to know
          when you don't know something. I try to keep this in mind when starting a new project.
        </p>

        <h3>I like to build things</h3>
        <p>
          even designed a thrust sensor for a rocket. I've dabbled in home brewing, once
          constructed a 15ft. tall trebuchet, and enjoy (continually) fixing my 1999 Jeep Cherokee. I grew up
          in a house full of tools, half-finished projects, and DIY attitudes, which has definitely shaped who
          I am today. In my experience, the two most important aspects of building (almost) anything is to view
          <a href="http://a16z.com/2014/04/16/shipping-is-a-feature-some-guiding-principals-for-people-that-build-things/"
          target="_blank">
            shipping as a feature
          </a> and to remember to have fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like to help others build things. I've advised startups, managed freelancers, and worked in tight-knit
          teams of programmers. Each of these areas have challenges and rewards. I appreciate thoughtful code reviews,
          sensible testing, and a pragmatic release process. Not all problems are technical in nature, so neither are
          all solutions. If you have something you'd like to build and you think I could help, then please

          In 2016, I joined Enigma to help them unlock value in public and enterprise data. My focus
          (so far) has been on client deployments, data visualizations, and data quality.

          S&amp;J had some unique ideas in mind for their wedding website that generic wedding

          I spent 2011-2015 working for a high frequency trading firm. I was a coder,
          trader, and project manager as the company grew from 50 to 100+ employees and
          in the top 5 firms by trading volume in the world. I learned a ton about systems
          programming, financial markets, and data science.

          An object oriented framework for solving and analyzing PDE that grew organically
          out of my <a href="thesis.html" target="_blank">graduate thesis</a>. The goal of the framework
          was to abstract away the mechanics so the researcher could spend more time focusing on
          solutions. The code can be found on <a target="_blank" href="http://wilsojb.io/pdelab">github</a>.
