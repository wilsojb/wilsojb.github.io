        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve been writing code for over a decade, and over that time many languages have had the dubious
          distinction of being my “main” language. I cut my teeth on TI-BASIC in high school and (more formally)
          on Java in undergrad, wrote a ton of C++ and Fortran90 for my graduate thesis, hacked Perl and Bash scripts
          together for Wall Street until I fell for Python. Sys admining a MongoDB cluster turned me on to Javascript.
          From there, I found AngularJS and Node which opened me up to a brand new world. Currently, I’m writing hybrid
          mobile apps using the Ionic Framework and Cordova. It’s been a humbling experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Python is still my area of expertise, but I’m learning more every day about modern client-side web technologies as
          well as Android and iOS integration. I used to be fairly dogmatic about object-oriented design (as is probably anyone
          that started with Java), but have lately been writing procedurally. I haven’t decided whether this produces better
          Javascript or if it’s just part of coping with the learning curve.
        </p>
        <h3>I like to build things</h3>
        <p>
          I've built mobile apps for both Android and iOS, written internal tools for a top hft firm, released
          a pde solver while in grad. school, and designed a thrust sensor for a rocket. I've dabbled
          in home brewing, constructed a trebuchet, and enjoy fixing a 1999 Jeep Cherokee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project management makes sense to me. If you have something you'd like to build, and you think I could
          help you, then please <a href="" ng-click="transition('home')">reach out</a>.

        <h3>TripExpert Mobile - <i>Coming Soon!</i></h3>
        <p>
          A mobile app for iOS and Android built using Cordova and the Ionic framework. This served
          as an entry point to AngularJS and Node. In all fairness, I outsourced the CSS.
        </p>
        <h3>Snapsite</h3>
        <p>
          “Simple (temporary) website deployment from the command line” An experiment that uses Flask,
          Google App Engine, and Datastore.

        <p>
          Maker of fine, hand-made Internet products right here in Brooklyn.

        <h3>Pdelab</h3>
        <p>
          “An object oriented framework for solving and analyzing numerical ODEs and PDEs written in C++”
          This project grew out of the code I wrote for my graduate thesis. It contains basic solvers,
          graphing utilities, a UI, and several examples. The code can be found on
          <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/wilsojb/pdelab">github</a>.
