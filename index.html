        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve been writing code for over a decade. Over that time, many languages have had the
          dubious distinction of being my “main” language. I cut my teeth on TI-BASIC in high
          school and (more formally) on Java in undergrad. C++ and Fortran90 came in handy during
          graduate school. I hacked Perl and Bash scripts for Wall Street for awhile before eventually
          finding (and falling for) Python. I've been the sys admin of a large<em>-ish</em> MongoDB
          cluster and also one of its lead developers. Somewhere along the way, I stumbled into Javascript
          and the rapidly evolving world of frontend tooling and frameworks. Lately, I've been contributing
          to <a target="_blank" href="http://enigma.io/parsekit/">ParseKit</a> at
          <a target="_blank" href="http://enigma.io">Enigma</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is still my area of expertise, but I'm constantly learning more about today's
          client-side web as well as mobile and desktop integration. While I'm good at implementing
          the layers needed to make things work, I am not comfortable with buzzwords like
          <a href="http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html" target="_blank">"Full-stack Developer"</a>.
          For the purposes of classification, the phrases "backend engineer", "internal tools developer",
          and "casual frontend developer" probably describe me the best. I also have experience doing the job
          of a "site reliability engineer" though I don't enjoy that line of work anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to be fairly dogmatic about object-oriented design (as is probably anyone that started with Java),
          but now I favor a more balanced approach. I value 80 char limits, simple interfaces, PEP8 compliance,
          and the spectrum between writing well-tested architectures and
          <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html" target="_blank">getting things done</a>.
          One of the most valuable skills a person can have is the ability to learn, closely followed by the ability to know
          when you don't know something. I try to keep this in mind when starting a new project.
        </p>

        <h3>I like to build things</h3>
        <p>
          I've built apps for both mobile and desktop, hacked on web crawlers, written internal tools for
          a top hft firm, and even designed a thrust sensor for a rocket. I've dabbled in home brewing, once
          constructed a 15ft. tall trebuchet, and enjoy (continually) fixing my 1999 Jeep Cherokee. I grew up
          in a house full of tools, half-finished projects, and DIY attitudes, which has definitely shaped who
          I am today. In my experience, the two most important aspects of building (almost) anything is to view
          <a href="http://a16z.com/2014/04/16/shipping-is-a-feature-some-guiding-principals-for-people-that-build-things/"
          target="_blank">
            shipping as a feature
          </a> and to remember to have fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like to help others build things. I've advised startups, managed freelancers, and worked in tight-knit
          teams of programmers. Each of these areas have challenges and rewards. I appreciate thoughtful code reviews,
          sensible testing, and a pragmatic release process. Not all problems are technical in nature, so neither are
          all solutions. If you have something you'd like to build and you think I could help, then please

          I took an 11 week machine learning course from <a target="_blank" href="https://generalassemb.ly">General Assembly</a>
          and walked away a jupyter notebook and scikit-learn aficionado. My final project involved clustering articles from my
          <a target="_blank" href="https://getpocket.com">getpocket.com</a> account using kmeans and a tf-idf vectorizor. I used
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.diffbot.com/">diffbot</a> for most of the ETL. All of the code can be found on

        <h3>S&amp;J Wedding Website</h3>
        <p>
          S&amp;J had some unique ideas in mind for their wedding website. Both being outgoing extroverts that
          love to entertain, they wanted their wedding website to reflect the awesome wedding weekend they
          had planned for their friends and families. Simply put, generic wedding website builders like
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theknot.com/">the knot</a> weren't gonna cut it. I used <b>M</b>ongoDB,
          <b>E</b>xpress, <b>A</b>ngularJS, and <b>N</b>ode.js for the stack and integrated
          <a target="_blank" href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> on top of it to provide a custom login for each of their
          guests.

          Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the
          process for subsequent articles, usually eventually gets you to the Philosophy article. I
          wrote some <a href="http://wilsojb.io/philosophy-challenge/", target="_blank">code</a> in
          Python that shows this is true. For more info, check out the actual

          I spent most of my time developing internal tools and services in Python
          and MongoDB, as the company grew from 60-100+ employees. This is
          where I learned everything I know about systems programming,
          test-driven development lifecycles, and the data pipeline. I played an
          integral role in converting a legacy code base into a library of tools that
          helped their business internationally scale. My day consisted of
          reviewing pull requests, committing quick fixes and new features, and
          dealing with the occasional market outage.

        <h3>Pdelab</h3>
        <p>
          An object oriented framework for solving and analyzing PDEs. This project grew organically while I worked on
          my <a href="http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/etd/id/3322" target="_blank">graduate degree</a>. The goal
          of the framework was to abstract away the mechanics and other "lower level" code needed to solve PDEs so the
          researcher can spend more time focusing on their solver (i.e. their "business logic"). The code can be found on
          <a target="_blank" href="http://wilsojb.io/pdelab">github</a>.
